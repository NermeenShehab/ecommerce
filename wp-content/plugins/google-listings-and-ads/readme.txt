== FAQ ==

= What is Google Merchant Center? =
The Google Merchant Center helps you sync your store and product data with Google and makes the information available for both free listings on the Shopping tab and Google Shopping Ads. That means everything about your stores and products is available to shoppers when they search on a Google property.

= Which countries are available for Google Listings & Ads? =
Learn more about supported countries for Google free listings [here](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/10033607?hl=en).

Learn more about supported countries and currencies for Smart Shopping campaigns [here](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160637#countrytable).

= Where will my products appear? =
If you’re selling in the US, then eligible free listings can appear in search results across Google Search, Google Images, and the Google Shopping tab. If you're selling outside the US, free listings will appear on the Shopping tab.

If you’re running a Smart Shopping campaign, your approved products can appear on Google Search, the Shopping tab, Gmail, Youtube and the Google Display Network.

= What are Smart Shopping campaigns? =
Smart Shopping campaigns are Google Ads that combine Google’s machine learning with automated bidding and ad placements to maximize conversion value and strategically display your ads to people searching for products like yours, at your given budget. The best part? You only pay when people click on your ad.

= How much do Smart Shopping campaigns cost? =
Smart Shopping campaigns are pay-per-click, meaning you only pay when someone clicks on your ads. You can customize your daily budget in Google Listings & Ads but we recommend starting off with the suggested minimum budget, and you can change this budget at any time.

= Can I run both free listings and Smart Shopping campaigns at the same time? =
Yes, you can run both at the same time, and we recommend it! In the US, advertisers running free listings and ads together have seen an average of over 50% increase in clicks and over 100% increase in impressions on both free listings and ads on the Shopping tab. Your store is automatically opted into free listings automatically and can choose to run a paid Smart Shopping campaign.
